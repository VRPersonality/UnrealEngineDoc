<p>Common uses would be for jumping, dashing, blast forces, etc. They are ticked as part of the Mover simulation, and produce a proposed move. These proposed moves are aggregated and applied to the overall attempted move. Multiple layered moves can be active at any time, and may produce additive motion or motion that overrides what the current Movement Mode may intend. Layered moves can also set a preferred movement mode that only changes the movement mode at the start of the move. Any movement mode changes that need to happen as part of the layered move after the start of the move need to be queued through an Instant Effect or the QueueNextMode function</p>
<p>Moves are composed of substeps, and these can be marked to indicate how they influence the final collapsed move. Relevancy means the substep (or part thereof) is contributing to the reflected movement state. Example: a character moves forward across a slightly irregular sidewalk, and then is adjusted downward to keep it sticking closely to the sidewalk. The forward move is a relevant substep, while the vertical heigh adjustment is not.</p>
<p>Used by many library functions. Only a scene component is required for movement, but this is typically a primitive component so we provide a pre-cast ptr for convenience.</p>
<p>Example usages: changing groups of settings, movement mode re-mappings, etc.</p>
<p>Note: Currently mover expects to only have one type of modifier active at a time. This can be fixed by extending the Matches function to check more than just type, but make sure anything used to compare is synced through the NetSerialize function.</p>

<p>going from Monolithic to Modular) Unfortunately, the Custom Package Versioning doesn't work for this case, because we're upgrading outside of the Serialize function. For that reason we want to store a <a class="el" href="classUProperty.html">UProperty</a> that says what version we're on. Unfortunately that propagates from Parent to Child (inheritance rules) so to overcome that, we have a special <a class="el" href="classUStruct.html" title="Base class for all UObject types that contain fields.">UStruct</a> that always serializes its data (so it will always be loaded, not inherited). Here is how to do that:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Return false in Identical (which effectively disables delta serialization).</li>
<li>Reset the value in PostInitProperties, thereby not using the inherited value on the initial preload.</li>
<li>Ensure the CurrentVersion field isn't marked up as a UPROPERTY to avoid automatic copying between parent/child.</li>
<li>Implement Serialize to ensure the CurrentVersion is still serialized.</li>
</ol>
<p>The property is automatically updated as the gameplay tag count changes. It only supports boolean, integer, and float properties.</p>
<p>It registers the properties with delegates on an ability system component. This struct can not be used in containers (such as <a class="el" href="classTArray.html" title="Templated dynamic array.">TArray</a>) since it uses a raw pointer to bind the delegate and it's address could change causing an invalid binding.</p>
<p>Note: this is similar to FComputeNegativeSpaceOptions, but with better default behavior and more intuitive parameters.</p>
<p>The Default Layer always exists, Extended layers may or may not exist.</p>
<p>Not all data necessarily needs to be specified, this will depend on the particular implementation. The comments below are representative of how this data structure is used in the Tools and API implementation(s) provided with Unreal Engine, but end-user implementors could abuse these fields as necessary.</p>
<p>The definition of a "texture object" is implementation-specific. In the <a class="el" href="namespaceUE.html" title="Utility functions for applying transformations to meshes.">UE</a> Editor this is generally a UTexture2D</p>
<p>You can inherit from this and include data passed to the operator and/or data used to determine an override of the node's interface.</p>

<p>The byte code is then used within a VM to execute. To iterate over the instructions within the byte code you can use GetInstructions() to retrieve a FRigVMInstructionArray.</p>
<p>Operands provide information about which memory needs to be referred to, which register within the memory all the way to the actual byte address in memory. The FRigVMOperand is a light weight address for a register in a FRigVMMemoryContainer. For external variables the register index represents the index of the external variable within the running VM.</p>
<p>Each element stored can be referred to using a FRigVMRegister. Elements can be accessed by index (index of the register), FRigVMOperand or by name. Name access is optional and is specified upon construction of the container. The memory container provides a series of templated functions to add and get data.</p>
<p>For example: <a class="el" href="Platform_8h.html#a8dbb3cd84ca9fd010dadfc3815eefa5d" title="A 32-bit signed integer.">int32</a> Index = Container.Add&lt;float&gt;(4.f); float&amp; ValueRef = Container.GetRef&lt;float&gt;(Index);</p>
<p>This can also be done with arrays: <a class="el" href="classTArray.html">TArray&lt;float&gt;</a> MyArray = {3.f, 4.f, 5.f}; <a class="el" href="Platform_8h.html#a8dbb3cd84ca9fd010dadfc3815eefa5d" title="A 32-bit signed integer.">int32</a> Index = Container.AddFixedArray&lt;float&gt;(MyArray); FRigVMFixedArray&lt;float&gt; ArrayView = Container.GetFixedArray&lt;float&gt;(Index);</p>

<p>When used with actor, it is generally enough to set the UserActor. In that case NavigationData, ValidationFilter, and UserCapsule are queried via the <a class="el" href="classINavAgentInterface.html">INavAgentInterface</a> and USmartObjectUserComponent on the actor if they are <em>not</em> set.</p>
<p>If the user actor is not available (e.g. with Mass), then ValidationFilter and UserCapsule must be defined, and if bProjectNavigationLocation is set NavigationData must be valid.</p>
<p>The location validation is done in following order:</p><ul>
<li>navigation projection</li>
<li>trace ground location (uses altered location from navigation test if applicable)</li>
<li>check transition trajectory (test between unmodified navigation location and slow location)</li>
</ul>
<p>When placed on a slot definition data, the Index is resolved automatically when changed, on load and save.</p>
<p>Properties will be used as user data to fill values expected by the world condition schema specified by the smart object definition. e.g. FilterSlotsBySelectionConditions(SlotHandles, FConstStructView::Make(FSmartObjectActorUserData(Pawn)));</p>

<p>The data can point to a struct or object. The code that handles StateTree ticking is responsible for passing in the actually data, see <a class="el" href="structFStateTreeExecutionContext.html" title="StateTree Execution Context is a helper that is used to update StateTree instance data.">FStateTreeExecutionContext</a>.</p>
<p>Source is the state where the transition started, Target describes the state where the transition pointed at, and Next describes the selected state. The reason Transition and Next are different is that Transition state can be a selector state, in which case the children will be visited until a leaf state is found, which will be the next state.</p>
<p>The data is identified by Frame (StateTree + RootState) and DataHandle.</p>
<p>It is used together with FStateTreeExecution context to tick the state tree. You are supposed to use FStateTreeInstanceData as a property to store the instance data. That ensures that any <a class="el" href="classUObject.html" title="The base class of all UE objects.">UObject</a> references will get GC'd correctly.</p>
<p>The FStateTreeInstanceData wraps FStateTreeInstanceStorage, where the data is actually stored. This indirection is done in order to allow the FStateTreeInstanceData to be bitwise relocatable (e.g. you can put it in an array), and we can still allow delegates to bind to the instance data of individual tasks.</p>
<p>Since the tasks in the instance data are stored in a array that may get resized you will need to use <a class="el" href="structTStateTreeInstanceDataStructRef.html" title="Stores indexed reference to a instance data struct.">TStateTreeInstanceDataStructRef</a> to reference a struct based task instance data. It is defined below, and has example how to use it. Storage for the actual instance data.</p>
<p>The layout of the data is described in a FStateTreeInstanceDataLayout.</p>
<p>Note: If FStateTreeInstanceData is placed on an struct, you must call AddStructReferencedObjects() manually, as it is not automatically called recursively. <br  />
 Note: Serialization is supported only for <a class="el" href="classFArchive.html#a16a3d0c8a0814635dba0bff4daf2e60f" title="Returns true if this archive should modify/search weak object references as well as strong ones.">FArchive::IsModifyingWeakAndStrongReferences()</a>, that is replacing object references.</p>
<p>Representation of a property reference binding in StateTree.</p>

<p>Stored compactly as two uint16s, which gives time range of about 650 seconds. The variance is symmetric (+-) around the specified duration.</p>
<p>It is useful for referencing larger properties to avoid copies of the data, or to be able to write to a bounds property.</p>
<p>The expected type of the reference should be set in "BaseStruct" meta tag.</p>

<p>As the engine brings up and destroys world, we need a way to keep straight what world belongs to what.</p>
<p>WorldContexts can be thought of as a track. By default we have 1 track that we load and unload levels on. Adding a second context is adding a second track; another track of progression for worlds to live on.</p>
<p>For the GameEngine, there will be one WorldContext until we decide to support multiple simultaneous worlds. For the EditorEngine, there may be one WorldContext for the EditorWorld and one for the PIE World.</p>
<p>FWorldContext provides both a way to manage 'the current PIE UWorld*' as well as state that goes along with connecting/travelling to new worlds.</p>
<p>FWorldContext should remain internal to the UEngine classes. Outside code should not keep pointers or try to manage FWorldContexts directly. Outside code can still deal with UWorld*, and pass UWorld*s into Engine level functions. The Engine code can look up the relevant context for a given UWorld*.</p>
<p>For convenience, FWorldContext can maintain outside pointers to UWorld*s. For example, PIE can tie UWorld* UEditorEngine::PlayWorld to the PIE world context. If the PIE UWorld changes, the UEditorEngine::PlayWorld pointer will be automatically updated. This is done with AddRef() and SetCurrentWorld().</p>

<p>Has priorities and different accumulation modes (override, additive, set, ignore).</p>
<p>RootMotionSources are accumulated from highest priority to lowest, once all values are "finalized" (meaning no more accumulation to those values), root motion accumulation is finished. Having all of translation and rotation in a transform being overridden during root motion accumulation means that CharacterMovementComponent Phys*() functions no longer need to CalcVelocity() since it'll just get overridden anyway.</p>
<p>Some example source possibilities: Full Animation Root Motion (matching only form of root motion we've supported historically):</p><ul>
<li>Overrides all translation axes or rotation or both</li>
<li>Very High priority so it gets applied first and since it is override no other RootMotionSources have an influence that are lower priority</li>
<li>Scale on translation and/or rotation is set to 1 to match animation 1 for 1</li>
<li>Provides local space transform (character-orientation relative)</li>
<li>End result: Same as before - overrides velocity/rotation to values in AnimMontage</li>
<li>But can now scale individual translation axes if desired, or instead of override can use "set" to allow other additive sources of root motion to be applied on top of the animation root motion (modify velocity to home root motion melee attacks, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Jump pad volumes that work during animation root montage attacks</p><ul>
<li>Constant velocity modification Z up, additive and high priority</li>
<li>Attack/melee animation root motion uses "set" instead of "override" to allow other sources</li>

</ul>

<p>A query that succeeds is said to "match". Queries are logical expressions that can test the intersection properties of another tag container (all, any, or none), or the matching state of a set of sub-expressions (all, any, or none). This allows queries to be arbitrarily recursive and very expressive. For instance, if you wanted to test if a given tag container contained tags ((A &amp;&amp; B) || (C)) &amp;&amp; (!D), you would construct your query in the form ALL( ANY( ALL(A,B), ALL(C) ), <a class="el" href="MediaOutput_8h.html#aea0c517a6651526c07befe7f7f8305d7ab50339a10e1de285ac99d4c3990b8693">NONE(D)</a> )</p>
<p>You can expose the query structs to Blueprints and edit them with a custom editor, or you can construct them natively in code.</p>
<p>Example of how to build a query via code: FGameplayTagQuery Q; Q.BuildQuery( <a class="el" href="structFGameplayTagQueryExpression.html">FGameplayTagQueryExpression()</a> .AllTagsMatch() .AddTag(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag(<a class="el" href="classFName.html" title="Public name, available to the world.">FName</a>(TEXT("Animal.Mammal.Dog.Corgi")))) .AddTag(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag(<a class="el" href="classFName.html" title="Public name, available to the world.">FName</a>(TEXT("Plant.Tree.Spruce")))) );</p>
<p>Queries are internally represented as a byte stream that is memory-efficient and can be evaluated quickly at runtime. Note: these have an extensive details and graph pin customization for editing, so there is no need to expose the internals to Blueprints.</p>
<p>Each "click" of a button should involve at minimum two separate state events, one where bPressed=true and one where bReleased=true. Each of these states should occur only once. In addition there may be additional frames where the button is held down and bDown=true and bPressed=false.</p>

<p>Assumption is that the state refers to a single physical input device, ie InputDevice field is a single value of EInputDevices and not a combination.</p>
<p>If the device is a 2D input device like a mouse, then the ray may have an associated 2D screen position.</p>

<p>Generally generated and accessed through UMovieSceneCompiledDataManager, but can also be used independently. Entity fields are constructed using <a class="el" href="structFMovieSceneEntityComponentFieldBuilder.html" title="Builder class used for populating an FMovieSceneEntityComponentField with data.">FMovieSceneEntityComponentFieldBuilder</a> which ensures the invariants of this class are maintained along with guaranteeing no redundant entries exist.</p>

<p>Stored as a stack inside FMovieSceneSequenceTransform to represent a complete transformation from inner time-space to outer time-space.</p>
<p>This uses a different class and API because the algorithms for computing the inverse of non-linear are different, often more complex, and can fail. Whereas an FMovieSceneSequenceTransform can only represent a 1:1 mapping from outer to inner space, its inverse is a (sometimes empty) many:many mapping.</p>
<p>Consider a looping transform with a duration of 10 frames: [0, 10). Every time in the outer space maps to a time in the inner space, but the opposite is not true. Only frames 0-10 exist in the inner space, and each frame in that time maps to an infinite number of solutions in the outer space. Conversely, any inner time outside the loop range, ie, [-inf, 0)..(10, +inf] cannot be transformed into the outer space.</p>
<p>For this reason, the API only has functions for attempting such computations (TryTransformTime), and iterating the solutions for any given time within a range.</p>
<p>The inverse of an inverse transform is the original transform such that T*(1/T)=I theoretically holds true, although transform multiplication is not actually supported by the API.</p>
<p>Transformation happens in the following order:</p>
<p>InputTime (relative to section start) &gt;&gt; Play Rate / Time Warp &gt;&gt; FrameRate conversion &gt;&gt; +StartTimeOffset &gt;&gt; Loop (% duration) &gt;&gt; Reverse</p>

<ul>
<li>A linear limit (a linear constraint), which is normally used to pin two bones together</li>
<li>An angular limit (an angular constraint), which is normally used to allow a limited range of rotational movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The joint is defined by a parent frame, which is attached to the parent body, and a child frame which is attached to the child body. If the limits are all zero, then these two bodies will be held in a fixed pose. Normally the angular limit will be relaxed to allow rotational movement around the joint position.</p>
<p>Most bodies in a character will have one Physics Joint which connects them to their parent in the hierarchy. However</p><ul>
<li>The root of the hierarchy will not have an enabled Physics Joint</li>
<li>There may be times when a body has additional Physics Joints.</li>
